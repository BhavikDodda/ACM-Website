    description: `The Summer Challenge is a unique endeavor by ACM NIT Surat, which strives to teach young computer science enthusiasts the fundamentals of data structures, algorithms and programming over a 30-day period. No prior experience form the students is expected. During this period, problem setters from our team hand-pick, curate, and create problems tailored to the studentsâ€™ current progress every week. Time is given to the students to attempt said problems, after which one of the problem setters solve those problems live, teaching students the right approach. This is repeated for 4 weeks, incrementing the conceptual difficulty every week, giving a complete understanding of various CP topics by the end of the month.`,
