I’m an aspiring researcher who is interested in low-level Computer Science domains. I’m fascinated by how extremely complex systems like the internet or the architecture in an average computer work in harmony to produce predictable results. This led me to exploring compiler technology and computer networking and am eager to explore other subdomains to find what clicks for me!

🎓 I’m a Computer Science & Engineering Undergrad at NIT Surat, Gujarat

🔭 I’m currently working towards my first open source contribution.

🌱 I’m currently learning about compiler technology.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on systems programming projects.

👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at https://github.com/BHsketch

💬 Ask me about C++, computer organization, compilers, computer networking
