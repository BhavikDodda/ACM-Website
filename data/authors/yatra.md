I’m a Full-stack Developer, working with the MERN tech stack.I am extremely comfortable with fetching varied data using the Axios library from third party databases for projects made using ReactJS. Currently, I’m focused on leveraging Express and Mongoose to build solutions for problems that require complex modeling.

🎓 I’m a Computer Science & Engineering Undergrad at NIT Surat, Gujarat

🔭 I’m currently working on building a full stack travel website.

🌱 I’m currently learning MERN in detail and all the frameworks that work well with MERN to add the coolest new features to my web apps.
